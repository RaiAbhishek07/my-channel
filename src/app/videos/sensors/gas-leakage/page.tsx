                        How can you build a device that warns you about a dangerous gas leak before it's too late? Gas leakage sensors are simple but critical components for detecting combustible gases like LPG and propane.

                             How It Works: Chemiresistors

                            <p>Most common gas leakage sensors are a type of chemiresistor, often part of the MQ sensor family (like the MQ-2 or MQ-6). Their electrical resistance changes when they come into contact with certain gases.</p>
                             <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
                                <li><strong>Detection:</strong> The sensor contains a sensing element made of a metal-oxide semiconductor (like Tin Dioxide, SnOâ‚‚), which is kept at a high temperature by a small internal heater.</li>
                                <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> In clean air, the material has a high electrical resistance. When combustible gas molecules come into contact with the heated sensing element, a chemical reaction occurs that lowers the material's resistance. The more concentrated the gas, the lower the resistance becomes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Output:</strong> The sensor module has a simple circuit that converts this change in resistance into a voltage. It provides an analog output (AOUT) pin where the voltage increases with the gas concentration. Many modules also have a digital output (DOUT) that goes HIGH when the concentration crosses a threshold that can be adjusted with an onboard potentiometer.</li>
