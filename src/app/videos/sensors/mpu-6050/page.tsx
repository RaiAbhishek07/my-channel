                        How does a drone stay perfectly level in the air? How does a VR headset track your head movements? It uses an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) like the MPU-6050, which combines multiple sensors to understand its motion in 3D space.

                             What It Is: Two Sensors in One
                        </h2>

                            <p>The MPU-6050 is a powerful chip that contains two different types of motion sensors (6 axes of measurement in total):</p>
                             <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>A 3-Axis Accelerometer:</strong> This measures linear acceleration along the X, Y, and Z axes. It's great for detecting tilt and the direction of gravity, but it's "noisy" and can be fooled by sudden movements.</li>
                                <li><strong>A 3-Axis Gyroscope:</strong> This measures angular velocity (how fast the sensor is rotating) around the X, Y, and Z axes. It's excellent for detecting rotation quickly, but it suffers from "drift" over time, where small errors accumulate and cause it to lose its sense of absolute orientation.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p className="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 text-foreground">
                                <strong>Sensor Fusion:</strong> The real power of the MPU-6050 comes from combining the data from both sensors. By using a mathematical technique called "sensor fusion" (often with a Kalman filter or a complementary filter), you can use the gyroscope for short-term rotation data and the accelerometer to correct the gyroscope's drift over the long term. This gives you a stable and accurate measurement of the sensor's orientation.
                            </p>
                             <p>The MPU-6050 even includes an onboard Digital Motion Processorâ„¢ (DMP) that can perform this complex sensor fusion for you, offloading the work from your main microcontroller.</p>
